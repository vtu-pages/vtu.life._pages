Hello, I am **Tinghao(Vitus) Xie 谢廷浩**, a senior undergraduate student majoring in [Computer Science and Technology](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn) at [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). Earlier, I just finished my one-term visit at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/).

* 📋 My **[[CV/resume]](/files/CV_TinghaoXie.pdf) [[Research Summary Slides]](/files/research_summary_full.pdf)**

<!-- My current research interest lies around secure, robust and reliable AI. The projects I am now working on and have finished involve neural network verification, certified and adversarial robustness, backdoor attacks and defenses. Building AI that makes human-like decisions attracts me, where robustness and security may be good perspectives to dive in. I have enthusiasm in explainable AI, out-of-distribution generalization, and potential ways to improve current models fundamentally. Yet, I'm always on my way looking for things that intrigue me, and tend to hold an open mind for whatever is coming. I (wish to) have fun doing research. -->

I found the **robustness of machine learning** being both a “dark cloud” and an attractive perspective to work on. Specifically, my research interest could be described in two aspects: First, I intend to study and solve security concerns involving current non-robust deep learning models; Second, I would like to better understand AI’s behaviors and make their predictions more human-like through explainable and causal methods. In summary, I hope to fully explore the breadth and depth of **secure, robust, and reliable AI**. Yet, I'm always on my way looking for things that intrigue me, and tend to hold an open mind for whatever is coming. I (wish to) have fun doing research.

Earlier, I just finished our project **Subnet Replacement Attack (SRA)**[[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12965)[[code]](https://github.com/Unispac/Subnet-Replacement-Attack) (submitted to CVPR'22) of the first gray-box and physically realizable backdoor weight attack, collaborating with [Xiangyu Qi](https://unispac.github.io) at Princeton University, advised by Principal Researcher Jifeng Zhu at Tencent Zhuque Lab and [Prof. Kai Bu](https://list.zju.edu.cn/kaibu/) at ZJU. Currently, I am fortunate to be working with [Prof. Ting Wang](https://alps-lab.github.io/about/) on **backdoor certification**[[preview]](/posts/2021/12/Backdoor-Certification/) and **backdoor restoration**[[preview]](/posts/2021/12/Backdoor-Trigger-Restoration/) at Pennsylvania State University as an intern, meanwhile co-advised by [Prof. Shouling Ji](https://nesa.zju.edu.cn/webpage/crew/jsl.html) at ZJU [NESA Lab](https://nesa.zju.edu.cn/index.html). Even before, I worked with [Prof. Jianghai Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/cjhe), designed and implemented **Enchecap**[[code]](https://github.com/vtu81/Enchecap), an encrypted (enclave-based) heterogeneous calculation protocol.

### News & Facts

* 🎓 **Seeking opportunities for a Ph.D./M.S. study**
* Received 22 Fall offers: ECE Ph.D.@Princeton, CS Ph.D.@GeorgiaTech, MSML@CMU, MSCS@UCSD (updating).
* My 🍫-abs are visible!!! To lose fat, healthy diets are way more important than exercises.
* Our new paper [Towards Practical Deployment-Stage Backdoor Attack on Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12965) (pre-print & under review) now available!
* 🔬 Currently working as a remote research intern @ [ALPS lab](https://alps-lab.github.io/alps/) (**A**lgorithmic Research on **L**earning, **P**rivacy and **S**ecurity), advised by Professor [Ting Wang](https://alps-lab.github.io/about/) at Penn State University.
* 💃 Interested in choreography and street dance. I especially enjoy *House* recently. Besides that, I do *Hiphop* a lot, and some *Breaking* too. BTW, I like *Locking* and *Popping* but not so good at them :)
* 🏊‍ Enjoy swimming as an aerobic exercise.
* 🏋 Go to gym regularly. It makes me happy!
* 🎱 Love playing billiards, basketball, bowling...
